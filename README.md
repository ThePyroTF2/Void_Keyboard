Void Keyboard
====
A while ago I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Ym9528awM) looking at [Riskable](https://github.com/Riskable)'s [Void Switches](https://github.com/Riskable/void_switch) and it immediately caught my fancy.
They were new, cool, and most importantly, you could make em yourself with relative ease.

Now, I'm making an entire keyboard from scratch.

huh.

PCB
----
Because of the nature of the switches, a keyboard using them would be analog using hall effect sensors. Thing is, there isn't any analog hall effect PCBs on the market right now, mainly because analog keyboards as a whole are fairly new, so anybody wanting to make a keyboard using Void Switches has to make their own PCB from scratch.
And, with help from Riskable, I'm doing that.

I've never worked with PCB stuff before, but I'm learning pretty quickly and while I feel a bit out of my league progress is going rather smoothly. The PCB takes a lot of time not because it's complex, but because it's got **112** keys.

I'm lucky enough to be going to an engineering magnet program at my high school so I _should_ have access to soldering tools and the like, although I'm not 100% certain. If not, I'll find a way.

Switches
----
Don't exist right now! I do know, however, that I can use my school's 3d printers to make em.

Case
----
No clue how the case is gonna go. Could I machine it at school? should I just be happy with printing it out? does i even frickin matter? Who knows?! All I presently care about is getting the circuitry done.

Firmware
----
The most important part to making a keyboard is the firmware. Without it, keyboard no make letters on screen. Thing is, Riskable is still working on it! I hope to help him out and I'll update with more information as time goes on, but as it stands I've got nothing here.

Overall stuffs
====
This is really cool for me. I can't wait to get it done. It's hella fun to learn this stuff and make something really tangible and working and I would really recommend you do it too.

Novel things I wanna try to do with this
----
* Variable volume changes

You may notice that I have volume controls using hall effect sensors as well. In all honesty, it mainly just makes it easier to work with, but I want to try something cool with increasing and decreasing the volume.
I want to make it so that the amount that the volume increases or decreases depends on how far you push the volume button down. The 100% down amount can change using the config, but I think it'd be cool

* Turbo mode

I'm thinking I make a fun button (the most obvious key that could be replaced for fun would be the options key) toggle a kind of turbo mode, where the further down you push a key the faster it goes. I'm not sure just how useful that would be, but it's an idea.

I'm going to keep brainstorming what kind of things could be done with analog inputs.
